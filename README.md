# Data-Science
Welcome to my Data Science repository!
This repo contains my personal work, assignments, coding notes, and project files from my data science learning journey. It's a collection of hands-on practice, course notes, and real-world data analysis tasks using tools like Python, R, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Power BI, and more.
